# micropython_ethernet

## BackStory
- Can I get 2 microcontrollers to use micropython to communicate over Ethernet?
- Turns out the answer is yes
- Your mileage may vary depending on what you want to do

##  Prerequisites

I had success with these:

## Pin Configuration

The pins are very clearly documented under the [WizNet Docs](https://github.com/Wiznet/RP2040-HAT-MicroPython/blob/main/Ethernet%20Example%20Getting%20Started%20%5BMicropython%5D.md):

## Full Micropython Example

## Takeaways/ Learnings
- I liked the small form factor better as they fit really nicely on the bread board for testing.
- I tried using a 6 inch Ethernet cable, but that failed
- I was able to use a 12 inch Ethernet cable
