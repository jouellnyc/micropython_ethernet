# micropython_ethernet

## BackStory
- Can I get 2 microcontrollers to use micropython to communicate over Ethernet?
- Turns out the answer is yes
- Your mileage may vary depending on what you want to do

##  Prerequisites

| Hardware | Link | 
|---|---|
|2 x Raspberry pi Picos|Amazon/Anywhere|
|USR-ES1 W5500 Ethernet Network Module Hardware <br> SPI to LAN/ Ethernet TCP ... W5100"|[AKA "Wiznet 5500](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804674673261.html)|
|Crossover Cable| [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I0E5EXU)

I had success with these USR-ES1 W5500 Ethernet Modules:

I had success with these Cable Matters cross over adapters:

## Installation 
- Download the latest Wiznet Firmware [here](https://micropython.org/download/W5500_EVB_PICO/)
- Install it by copying the u2f per usuall after holding the BOOTSEL button and powering on the pico via USB.
- It should be rebooted and then show:

## Connecting via DHCP or Static IP

NOTES:

```
If you use the Dynamic IP(DHCP), you must use the "nic.ifconfig('dhcp')" syntax:
    nic.ifconfig('dhcp')
    
If you use the Static IP, you must use the  "nic.ifconfig("IP","subnet","Gateway","DNS")".
    nic.ifconfig(('192.168.100.13','255.255.255.0','192.168.100.1','8.8.8.8'))
   
```

You should set both to static if they are connecting only to each other. 

IMPORTANT: You much use a cross over cable or cross over module to connect both togeher.

You can try DHCP if you connect one of them up to a LAN w/a DHCP server.


## Full Micropython Example

```
import time
import network
from machine import Pin,SPI

spi=SPI(0,2_000_000, mosi=Pin(19),miso=Pin(16),sck=Pin(18))
nic = network.WIZNET5K(spi,Pin(17),Pin(20)) #spi,cs,reset pin
nic.active(True)
nic.ifconfig(('192.168.0.249', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.197', '8.8.8.8'))
time.sleep(2)
print(nic.isconnected())
print(nic.regs())
print(nic.ifconfig())
print(nic.active())

```

## Pin Configuration

The pins are very clearly documented under the [WizNet Docs](https://github.com/Wiznet/RP2040-HAT-MicroPython/blob/main/Ethernet%20Example%20Getting%20Started%20%5BMicropython%5D.md):

## Takeaways/ Learnings
- I liked the small form factor better as they fit really nicely on the bread board for testing.
- I tried using a 6 inch Ethernet cable, but that failed
- I was able to use a 12 inch Ethernet cable
- I don't actually suggest to connect 2 MCUs on a breadboard via ethernet, it's just too big and unwieldy, but it was fun.
